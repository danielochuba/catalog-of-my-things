# 📖   Catalog Of Things<a name="about-project"></a>

**Catalog Of Things** is a console app that will help you to keep a record of different types of things you own: books, music albums and games. Everything is based on the UML class diagram presented below. The data is stored in JSON files but we also prepared a database with tables structure analogical to your program's class structure.
